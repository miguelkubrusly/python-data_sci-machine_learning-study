# Python: Data Science & Machine Learning Study

This repository was created to follow the intensive **Data Science and Machine Learning with Python** course. Below, youâ€™ll find information about the course content, progress, and links to additional materials and study notebooks.

## About the Course

The course is designed for anyone who wants to become a Data Scientist, starting with Python basics and advancing to more complex Machine Learning topics. It covers Python for data analysis, data visualization, SQL data handling, and Machine Learning algorithms. Some of the main skills covered include:

- Python programming, including `NumPy` and `pandas`.
- Complex data manipulation and handling Excel files.
- Data collection using web scraping.
- Creating interactive visualizations with `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`.
- Implementing Machine Learning algorithms with `SciKit-Learn`, such as:
  - Linear Regression
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Random Forests and Decision Trees
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  - Neural Networks and Deep Learning
  - Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
